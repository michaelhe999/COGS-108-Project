    "  - Number of observations: 3092\n",
    "  - Number of variables: 7\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BLS OEWS:\n",
    "This dataset encompasses 2006-2023 employment data by metropolitan/non-metropolitan area. Our cleaned dataset has 8 areas, each of which were chosen because of their proximity to one of the schools we are analyzing. The important variables in the data set are year, location, occupation title (string), total employment (int), and average salary (int), although the other fields we left in the dataset also help with general analysis and classification. The employment count proportion and the salary may be proxies for overall desirability of the job. \n",
    "\n",
    "To clean this dataset, we had to download all the `.xls` and `.xlsx` files from the BLS, convert them to `.csv`s, and then pull only the relevant areas from each year's dataset. Then, to combine the datasets and standardize the columns, some columns were dropped or renamed, leading to the overall dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### CDS:\n",
    "This dataset encompasses 8 US universities, which were chosen for reasons listed in our [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19kN52hyig4k--l1GXVEiIQVoSM10L_shYSVXepYsSDM/edit?usp=sharing). The most limiting university was Colgate University, with the first CDS being from 2014, so the years span from 2014 graduation to 2023 graduation degrees conferred. This gives us a good 10 year window to work with. The important variables in this dataset are year, college, Category (major), and Bachelor's (a percentage of the graduating class). The major percentages may be proxies for the overall desirability of the major. \n",
    "\n",
    "To clean this dataset, we had to download all the `.pdf` files of the CDS from each school. We then created and ran a pdf scraper to pull the Degrees Conferred table from each PDF; there were a few cases where this had to be done manually because of inconsistent formatting or lack of downloadable PDF. Then, to combine the datasets, equivalent columns were combined, leading to the overall dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Combining\n",
    "To combine these datasets, it's necessary to line up majors at colleges with jobs. This means we will probably use a classifier to fit the jobs in 'OCC-TITLE' to the majors in 'Category'. Then, we can graph the relationships between employment rates and major trends. "
