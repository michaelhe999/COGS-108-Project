    "It can easily be stated that people go to college in order to get a job after graduation. Since the major that students graduate with affect the industry they can work in after graduation, it seems like a natural assumption that the job market has some effect on what subject students choose to major in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Research has been done on similar topics; Baker et. al posits that community college graduates are about 1.5% more likely to choose a major that corresponds with a 1% increase in salary <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). Utilizing logit models to estimate the probabilities of different major selections and Ordinary Least Squares to model the relationship between major choice, employment security, and salary expectations, the paper concludes that community college students have less access to accurate job market information, and thus mostly consider course enjoyment, while barely considering employment probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, Long et. al find that college majors are most strongly tied to salaries from 3 years before graduation (when most students have to choose their major) <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). Their analysis covered both national and state (Washington) wage and major trends, using regression models to estimate the association between major choice and wage rates from a few years ago. They also used Granger causality tests to measure if previous data on wages were predictive of major choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite there being a lot of research tying the job market to student major choices, we found little research analyzing the effects of employment rates in various industry sectors on major choice. We also aim to analyze a wider range of factors, covering different university locations and university types (public vs. private). This is because we’ve seen some research show that location affects college education, but not necessarily the major distributions at those locations <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). While we have seen that the job market has significant influence on major choices, we aim to discover the timeframe between the job market and major effects, as well as if the local or national job market has more influence.\n",

   "source": [
    "We predict that undergraduate major students are influenced by job market trends, with the strongest correlation between the majors students select and the job market conditions from approximately 4 years prior to when they first enter college. Specifically, we believe that national job market trends, such as wage growth and demand within central industries (e.g., healthcare, technology), will show a strong correlation with the selection of undergraduate majors across the United States. Furthermore, local job market trends, including employment opportunities and industry-specific demand will have a stronger influence on the major selection at universities such as UCSD, where students are more prone to aligning their academic focus with the region’s economic landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this study, we would define major choice as the number of individuals who graduated with the major (or a similar one), and job market trends as the number of jobs in that field. Since our background research shows that factors such as wages affect major choice, it can be assumed that the increased possibility of finding a job in that field (which would lead to the receiving wages in the first place), would also be a factor in people’s major decision. We believe that these two variables would have a positive correlation — as the number of jobs in a certain field increases, so does the number of college students who choose a related major."

    "  - Number of observations: 3092\n",
    "  - Number of variables: 7\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BLS OEWS:\n",
    "This dataset encompasses 2006-2023 employment data by metropolitan/non-metropolitan area. Our cleaned dataset has 8 areas, each of which were chosen because of their proximity to one of the schools we are analyzing. The important variables in the data set are year, location, occupation title (string), total employment (int), and average salary (int), although the other fields we left in the dataset also help with general analysis and classification. The employment count proportion and the salary may be proxies for overall desirability of the job. \n",
    "\n",
    "To clean this dataset, we had to download all the `.xls` and `.xlsx` files from the BLS, convert them to `.csv`s, and then pull only the relevant areas from each year's dataset. Then, to combine the datasets and standardize the columns, some columns were dropped or renamed, leading to the overall dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### CDS:\n",
    "This dataset encompasses 8 US universities, which were chosen for reasons listed in our [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19kN52hyig4k--l1GXVEiIQVoSM10L_shYSVXepYsSDM/edit?usp=sharing). The most limiting university was Colgate University, with the first CDS being from 2014, so the years span from 2014 graduation to 2023 graduation degrees conferred. This gives us a good 10 year window to work with. The important variables in this dataset are year, college, Category (major), and Bachelor's (a percentage of the graduating class). The major percentages may be proxies for the overall desirability of the major. \n",
    "\n",
    "To clean this dataset, we had to download all the `.pdf` files of the CDS from each school. We then created and ran a pdf scraper to pull the Degrees Conferred table from each PDF; there were a few cases where this had to be done manually because of inconsistent formatting or lack of downloadable PDF. Then, to combine the datasets, equivalent columns were combined, leading to the overall dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Combining\n",
    "To combine these datasets, it's necessary to line up majors at colleges with jobs. This means we will probably use a classifier to fit the jobs in 'OCC-TITLE' to the majors in 'Category'. Then, we can graph the relationships between employment rates and major trends. "

The bias arising from the top selected major rankings can be overcome by drawing information out from diverse sources which reduces dependency on any specific dataset. We are also focusing specifically on undergraduate graduation rates, which might not reflect people who only attend community college without transferring to a 4-year institution, trade schools, or any other form of schooling, since they would also be entering the job market. The best way to address this is to specify that our findings are specifically for 4-year undergraduate students and at the specific colleges we select, since the selection may not be completely random.\n"
